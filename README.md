# your-own-browser

Prerequisites:
- [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
- Git (search for instructions on how to install git for your operating system)
- Node, either through [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) or [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

## Step 1
Install gulp-cli: `npm install gulp-cli -g`

Gulp is a pre-processor, we'll be using it to efficiently package our SCSS (sass) files into a single CSS file.

CSS files contain rules that tell browsers how to display structured information.

## Step 2

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mitchazj/your-own-browser/`

Install the required packages: `npm install`
